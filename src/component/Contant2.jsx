              This part of the UI is a great example of when you need to pack a
              ton of important functionality in a relatively small space—all
              while making it look clean and enjoyable to use.

              Voice of Customer and competitor analysis made it clear that we
              were going to need to support public and private messages. There
              were concerns about mixing{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">public</span> and{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">private</span> messages in the same
              space because it may be hard to orient yourself in the
              conversation. I opted to use the{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">tab</span> component to bifurcate the
              experience at the highest level. User testing confirmed that this
              decision cut down on cognitive load because users can trust that
              everything in one area is public, and everything in another area
              is all private.

            uncovered was that there was no visibility into what agent(s) were
            working on a specific ticket. This often led to agents unknowingly
            editing a ticket at the same time, and that experience was confusing
            and frustrating if their work was undone or not saved.

            live editing of fields and situations where someone is actively
            typing in the message composer.

              As we interviewed helpdesk support agents we kept hearing a

              provided, agents wanted to create their own custom filtered views
              and be able to save the views.
